OpenFly is an innovative platform designed to advance research in outdoor aerial Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) by providing a highly automated toolchain for data collection and a large-scale benchmark dataset. It includes 100k diverse flight trajectories, high-quality visual data generated using cutting-edge rendering techniques, and OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, all of which will be open-sourced to support the community.

# Dataset
The dataset is being uploaded to Huggingface and Opendatalab, which will take some time. The Opendatalab dataset will be uploaded around this week (3.16). HuggingFace has a slower upload speed and still needs some time, please understand.ðŸ˜­
